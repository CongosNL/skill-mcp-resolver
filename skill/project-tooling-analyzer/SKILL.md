# Project Tooling Analyzer

Analyzes project directories and recommends AI assistant skills and MCP servers for effective development, maintenance, and evolution.

## Overview

This skill performs three core functions:
1. **Inventory** - Detect currently installed skills/MCPs across AI assistants
2. **Analyze** - Identify project tech stack from config files
3. **Recommend** - Suggest relevant tools from marketplaces, or scaffold new ones

## When to Use

- Starting work on a new/unfamiliar codebase
- After significant dependency changes (new framework, database, etc.)
- When asked "what tools do I need for this project?"
- Periodically to check for new relevant tooling
